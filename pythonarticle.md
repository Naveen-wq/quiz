## HISTORY OF PYTHON
``  The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020. ``

## FEATURES OF PYTHON

#### Difficulty Level : Basic
### Last Updated : 22 Jun, 2020
### Python is a dynamic, high level, free open source and interpreted programming language. It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural oriented programming.
### In Python, we don’t need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language.
### For example, x = 10
### Here, x can be anything such as String, int, etc.

Features in Python
There are many features in Python, some of which are discussed below –

### 1. Easy to code:
Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in python language and anybody can learn python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language.

### 2. Free and Open Source:
Python language is freely available at the official website and you can download it from the given download link below click on the Download Python keyword.
Download Python
Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public. So you can download it as, use it as well as share it.

#### 3. Object-Oriented Language:
One of the key features of python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, objects encapsulation, etc.
### 4. GUI Programming Support:
Graphical User interfaces can be made using a module such as PyQt5, PyQt4, wxPython, or Tk in python.
PyQt5 is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.

### 5. High-Level Language:
Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in python, we do not need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory.

### 6. Extensible feature:
Python is a Extensible language. We can write us some Python code into C or C++ language and also we can compile that code in C/C++ language.

### 7. Python is Portable language:
Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have python code for windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.

### 8. Python is Integrated language:
Python is also an Integrated language because we can easily integrated python with other languages like c, c++, etc.

### 9. Interpreted Language:
Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time. like other languages C, C++, Java,etc. there is no need to compile python code this makes it easier to debug our code. The source code of python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.

### 10. Large Standard Library
Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of module and functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.

### 11. Dynamically Typed Language:
Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means the type (for example- int, double, long, etc.) for a variable is decided at run time not in advance because of this feature we don’t need to specify the type of variable.
**_ Python allows us to produce maintainable features in record times, with a minimum of developers. _**
